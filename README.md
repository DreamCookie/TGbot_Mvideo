# TGbot_Mvideo
The program parses information from the store's website into a number of json files:
1_products_ids.json, 
2_products_descriptions.json, 
3_products_prices.json

Merges the information into the resulting file:
4_result.json

The bot gets the information from the last file, displaying the information to the user in portions of 3 products. If the user needs to continue searching, there is a button to work with pagination
